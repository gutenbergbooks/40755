<h2>LUCY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/illus097b.png" width="140" height="175" alt="L" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />UCY is three years old. She is one of the happiest
little girls that I know, and one of the sweetest
too. That is saying a good deal; for I know a
great many very charming little girls.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>You would not suppose that such a little tot could be
left to herself a great while. But often, when she is tired
of running about, her mother seats her in the great arm-chair,
and there, with her doll in her arms, she sits and
amuses herself for hours.</p>

<p>Jip the dog is very fond of Lucy, and very jealous of the
doll. If he comes in and sees Lucy and her doll in the arm-chair,
he begins to whine.</p>

<p>Then Lucy says in her baby-way (for she cannot yet talk
plain), "Come here, Jip!"</p>

<p>Jip jumps up into the chair. Lucy puts her arm round
him and pats him fondly. Jip looks up in her face, as much
as to say, "Don't you love me, Lucy? Am I not as good
as the doll? Why don't you pat me?"</p>

<p>Lucy knows what he means just as well as if he said it in
words. "Yes, Jip, you good little dog, I do love you," she
says, "and Dolly loves you too. You will take good care
of us; won't you, Jip?"</p>

<p>And Jip seems to know what Lucy says; for he answers
by another loving look, "Yes, Lucy, I will take care of you.
Nobody shall harm you while I am here. I will be your
watch-dog. But don't forget to pet me as well as your doll.
I like to be petted."</p>

<p>Then Lucy pats him, and says, "Good little Jip, I will
never forget you!" That makes him happy; and so they
are both happy together.</p>

<h2>THE SAVOYARD.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="68" height="150" alt="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HIS boy, as you may see by his looks, is not one of
our American boys. He is a native of Savoy, and
is dressed in the costume of the peasants of that
country.</div>

<p>Savoy is in the eastern part of France, just south
of the Lake of Geneva. You will easily find it on the map.
It is a fertile country, but there are many poor people there
who live chiefly upon chestnuts and potatoes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/illus101.png" width="386" height="500" alt="Boy holding guiniea pigs" />
</div>
<p>Though fond of their birthplace, many of them leave it
during the winters, and go to Italy, Spain, and other parts
of France in search of work.</p>

<p>Carl, the boy in the picture, is one of this class. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
parents are too poor to support him, and he is sent out to
seek his own living; but he is not a beggar. He earns
something by raising guinea-pigs, which he sells to boys
and girls for pets. He carries them, as you see, in a box
slung from his neck. But they are so tame that he takes
them out and lets them run up on his shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus102.png" width="300" height="290" alt="Guinea pig" />
</div>

<p>The guinea-pig, when full-grown, is not much bigger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a large rat. In shape it is a good deal like a fat pig. When
hungry it grunts like a pig. In color it is white, spotted
with orange and black. It is a native of Brazil.</p>



<p>Guinea-pigs serve very well for pets. Some children are
very fond of them. But old folks like me prefer pets of
another sort.</p>

<h2>A BEAR'S STORY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="60" height="150" alt="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /> &nbsp; WAS born in the wild woods of Michigan, and my
home was in a large hollow tree which stood near
the Muskegon River. There I lived with my mother
and sister.</div>

<p>I was a careless young cub, and one day, when at
play on the river-side, I went too near the steep bank, fell
over it, and went down splash into the water. It was very
deep, and there was a strong current. I had never been
taught to swim. I was in such a fright that I could not
even cry for help.</p>

<p>The water was choking me, and I was nearly drowned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
when a kind log came floating by to my rescue. It seemed
like a friend sent from home. I scrambled to the top of it,
bade good-by to my sister, who stood crying on the bank, and
went drifting down the river.</p>

<p>Before long two queer-looking objects came toward me,
paddling along in a sort of hollow log. Seeing plainly that
they were not bears, I felt much afraid of them. My
mother had often talked to me about some fierce creatures
called "men," and had told me always to keep out of their
way.</p>

<p>I felt sure that these were men; but how could I get out
of their way when I was adrift on a log? They came right
down upon me, and there I sat, whining and crying and
trembling. "What were these dreadful men made for?"
thought I. "Why can they not leave us poor bears in
peace?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus103.png" width="500" height="206" alt="Bear cub on a log in water" />
</div>

<p>I fully expected to be killed. But, instead of killing me,
one of the men took me in his arms, and held me till we
came to the shore. Then I wanted to go back to my
mother, and I tried to get away. But he held me all the
tighter, and after a while he tied my feet together. I could
do nothing but cry, and at last I cried myself to sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>When I awoke I found myself in this town, called "Big
Rapids," and here I have been ever since. It seemed to me
very strange at first not to be in the woods, but in the midst
of queer-looking white objects called "houses."</p>

<p>I started to take a walk, hoping to fall in with some bear
of my acquaintance; but a hard thing fastened to my neck
held me back. It is what men call a "chain," as I have since
learned, and it compels me to stay in one place all the time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus104.png" width="350" height="322" alt="Bear enjoying apple" />
</div>

<p>I am no longer a cub, but am a full-grown bear. This
kind of life does not suit me very well, but I have got used to
it. One can get used to almost any thing. I have even got
used to the society of men and women.</p>

<p>Their cubs (called boys and girls) often play with me, and
sometimes they tease me. Once, when a boy was teasing
me, I gave him a scare which will be apt to teach him better
manners. I will tell you how it was.</p>

<p>The boy held out an apple, and, just as I was about to
take it, he pulled it away. This mean trick he played three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
times. He tried it once more, and then I gave such a spring
that my chain broke.</p>

<p>The boy dropped his apple, and ran. You ought to have
seen that boy run! He didn't dare even to look back. But,
if he had looked back, he would have seen me munching his
apple with great relish.</p>

<p>I didn't want to hurt a cub like him; but some bears that
I know wouldn't have been so for-<i>bear</i>-ing.</p>

That keenly creaks, it is frozen so:<br />
What does he care if the wind does blow?&mdash;<br />
Sturdy lad, with his face aglow,<br />

And loves to feel, as he tramps along,<br />
He is conquering something: it makes him strong,&mdash;<br />

What does he conquer? Wind and frost.<br />
Hands in mittens, and tippet crossed<br />

Well indeed may the lad feel bold<br />
To battle the cold, and fight his way<br />
Early to school, and every day,&mdash;<br />

He'll sing and whistle, he'll run and shout,<br />
To keep him warm; but he'll never pout:<br />
If the frost creeps in, he whips it out,<br />
With his two hands thrashing his shoulders stout;<br />
While on he goes, and the keen snow rings<br />
To the song he sings, for his sturdy feet<br />
The changing time of that music beat,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Robert, the miller's boy.</span><br />
<br />
You need not think to find him low<br />
When the busy classes stand in row;<br />
You need not think to find him slow<br />
When play-time comes, and the trampled snow<br />
Makes a path for his "lightning" sled:<br />
The boy at the head is the conquering lad<br />
Who makes his way if the road <i>is</i> bad,&mdash;<br />

<p>There are four boys and three girls. The two youngest
boys, Dwight and Louis, are twins. They are the emperors.</p>

<p>Their reign began nearly three years ago. Master Ted,
the next elder brother, who was then emperor, had to give
way to them, and very sweetly he did it. It was hard for
him to see his dear old Chinese nurse transfer her love and
care to any one else; and even now, when he hears her call
one of the emperors her "little pet," he says to her, "But
you know you have a big pet too."</p>

<p>Thus far the twin-emperors have had none but loyal subjects;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
but, as they grow out of their babyhood, there are
signs of rebellion. The three sisters rebel because Emperors
Dwight and Louis will not let them practise their music-lessons
in peace. Ted says, "Do find me a place where I
can pound nails alone;" for the emperors will insist upon
helping him.</p>

<p>The emperors have already learned to walk, though they
talk only in a language of their own. When they begin to
talk plainly in the language of their subjects, I fear that
their reign will come to an end.</p>

<p>The picture shows you how ten-year-old brother Ned takes
his three little brothers to ride on his donkey.</p>

<h2>THE BIRD WHO HAS NO NEST.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="68" height="150" alt="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HIS is the cuckoo. She and her mate
have no home of their own; but that
does not seem to trouble them. They peep
here and there among the leaves, until they
find the nest of some other bird,&mdash;a lark,
perhaps, or a thrush, or a yellow-hammer;
and, if the owner of the nest is away, Mrs. Cuckoo leaves
within it a small egg.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/illus114.png" width="192" height="200" alt="The cuckoos" />
</div>

<p>There are some birds that can take care of themselves
almost as soon as they are born; but Mrs. Cuckoo never
leaves her eggs in their nests. Oh, no! she chooses a nest
in which the young birds are well cared for by their mothers,
and fed with food on which the young cuckoos thrive best.</p>

<p>Why she is too idle to build her own nest, no one knows.
Some people say it is because she stays so short a time in
the same country, that her young ones would not get strong
enough to fly away with her, if she waited to build her nest.
Others think it is because she is such a great eater, that she
cannot spend time to find food for her children.</p>

<p>But the kind foster-mothers, the larks and the thrushes,
care for the egg that the cuckoo leaves in their houses,
although, if any other bird leaves one, they will take no care
of it at all, but roll it out upon the ground.</p>

<p>The Scotch word for cuckoo, <i>gowk</i>, means, also, a foolish
person. But I think they ought rather to have named it a
wicked person; for the young cuckoo is so ungrateful and
selfish, that he often gets one of the other little birds on his
back, and then, climbing to the top of the nest, throws it over
the edge. These are the English cuckoos of which I
have been telling you. I am glad to say that their American
cousins take care of their own children.</p>

<img src="images/illus115b.png" width="76" height="150" alt="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />N countries where the Roman-Catholic religion prevails,
a shrine signifies a box or case containing an
image of the Virgin Mary, or some relics regarded
as sacred.</div>

<p>This box is attached to a stone pillar or other
fixed monument, and thus marks a place at which the
pious Catholics kneel to offer up their prayers.</p>

<p>In Italy and Spain shrines are very common, not only in
the churches, but at the roadsides. The picture shows us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>

we often speak of any hallowed place as a shrine.</p>

<h2>SUSIE'S DANCING-LESSON.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="82" height="150" alt="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HEN Susie is fretful and peevish,&mdash;which, I am
glad to say, is not often,&mdash;there is nobody who
can put her in good humor so quickly as her grown-up
sister Ann. She knows just how to deal with
the little girl.</div>

<p>Thus Ann will say, "What is the matter, Susie? Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
you hungry? No. Are you sleepy? Not a bit of it. Do you
want me to tell you a story? No. Are you tired? No.
I have it: you want a good dose of exercise. That is the
very thing you need. Come here now, and I'll give you a
dancing-lesson."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<img src="images/illus118.png" width="393" height="550" alt="Sister Ann dancing with Susie" />
</div>

<p>She takes Susie's hands, and whirls her out on the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
before she has time to say a word. Then Ann begins to
sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Here we go up, up, up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And here we go down, down, down-y;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here we go this way and that,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And here we go round, round, round-y,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>dancing all the time, and whisking Susie about the room
in such a lively way, that the child has to laugh in spite of
herself. Susie soon gets in great glee, and always wants to
have another dance.</div>

<p>"What!" says Ann. "Haven't you had dancing enough?
Well, then, how would you like a fancy dance? Mind your
steps now. Do as you see me do. Keep time with the
music.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Up and down, fast and slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hop and skip, and away we go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Round and round, and jump Jim Crow:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, won't we dance the polka!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>So the little girl is danced about until she has to stop to
take breath; and by that time she is so full of fun, that
there is no room for a frown on her pretty face.</p>

no front-door, no back-door. Yet it
was once the home of a happy family; and,
if you went near it, you would hear their
sweet low voices from morning till night.
Such was this little house when I visited
it one fine day last summer.</div>

<p>To-day I called again. All was still. Not a voice did I
hear. The roofless house was filled with snow. The walls
looked dark and sad. The leaves that once cast lovely
shadows about them were gone.</p>

<p>As I stood looking at the empty house, Ethel, who is very
young but very wise, exclaimed, "The family have gone
south for the winter, but are sure to come back in the
spring. There will be gay times here pretty soon."</p>

<p>Just then a sharp gust of wind came, and the old house
shook as if about to fall. Ethel stood ready to catch it.</p>

<p>What, a child catch a falling house, as if it were a baseball!
What if the timbers should strike her? Ah! but
this house was a very light building. Snow and all, it was
not much heavier than a handful of roses.</p>

<p>Now you know what I mean. Vine Street runs from the
floor to the top of the piazza. The swallow homestead is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
just at the head of that street. The timbers are sticks and

<div class="figleft" style="width: 62px;">
<img src="images/drop_o.png" width="62" height="150" alt="O" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />LD Bossy had been on the farm many years. She
was a very fine cow in her prime; but as she grew
old she learned some bad tricks. Although gentle
and kind in the stable, she would push down fences,
and open every gate on the farm. She would get
into the cornfields, make herself at home in the wheat and
oats, and do a great deal of mischief.</div>

<p>Some check had to be put upon her. So one day she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
went to the pasture with her head tied down to her foot by
a strong rope. In about three hours a man came running
up to the house, to tell us that old Bossy had fallen over a
log, and was lying on her back.</p>

<p>Now, if a cow gets down on her back, in this way, in
a place where she cannot turn over, she is in great danger.
It is called being "cast." This man said, "Come quickly,
for old Bossy is cast." Every one ran to the pasture, and
by much pulling and lifting got the cow up. She looked
very happy to be on her feet once more; but as soon as the
rope was cut she was at her old tricks again.</p>

<p>The very next day she was found quietly eating down a
neighbor's corn. Something must be done. We did not
like to tie her head down again: so we concluded to put a
board over her eyes.</p>

<p>The board was brought, and fastened with cords to her
horns. She stopped chewing her cud at once and stood still.
The men left her in the lane that led to the pasture, and
went to their work. She did not move. I don't think she
even whisked her tail to drive away the flies.</p>

<p>When the men came home to dinner, they were surprised
to see her still standing in the very place where they left
her. They patted her kindly, took the board off, and saw
on her forehead a spot as large as a man's hand, where the
hair had turned grayish-white. There was not a bit of white
on her forehead before the board was put on. The poor
thing had begun to turn gray from sheer fright.</p>

<p>We all felt sorry for her; and the board was never again
tied to her horns. After a time she began to chew her cud,
and seemed all right; and she went on pushing down the
fences, and opening the gates, just as often as before. This
is a true story.</p>

A gay burst of song from a wee bit of blue,<br />
Poised daintily there on the maple-twig now,<br />
Like a bright little blossom upon the bare bough,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Tu-ra-la, tu-ra-lee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We're coming, you see:</span><br />
I'm building my nest in the old apple-tree.<br />
<br />
"To you, little children, this message I bring,<br />
The birds, every one, will return with the spring.<br />
What care I if cold winds are blowing around!<br />
The flowers are already awake under ground.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tu-ra-la, tu-ra-lee:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If snowflakes I see,</span><br />
I'll dream they are blooms shaken off from the tree.<br />
<br />
"Hark! the shy little brooklet is humming a song<br />
As it breaks loose from winter, and dances along.<br />
How happy we'll be through the blithe summer hours,&mdash;<br />
The children, the sunbeams, the birds, and the flowers!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tu-ra-la, tu-ra-lee:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How busy we'll be,</span><br />
My sweet mate and I, in the old apple-tree!"<br />
